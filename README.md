# W3Schools Database - postgreSQL

Anyway this repository contains sql statements to create the database we see on w3schools SQL tutorial here:
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp

You can see the database tables and the data on the right hand side if you run this example:
https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_select_all

Since there is no link provided to re-create the databse on your local envionmnet, I forked the https://github.com/AndrejPHP/w3schools-database and modified the statements so that it works for posrgreSQL.
